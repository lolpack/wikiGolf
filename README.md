#wikiGolf#

This is the first full project made for CodeFellows. I'm using Flask.py on the backend and Backbone.js on the frontend as a MV.

I'm using the Wikipedia API to grab all of the data for the page and storing some preloaded courses in a MongoDB instance on Heroku.

The app is available here : <a href = 'http://wikigolfpro.herokuapp.com/'>http://wikigolfpro.herokuapp.com/</a>
